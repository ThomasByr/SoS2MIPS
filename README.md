## ‚úèÔ∏è Setup

> **Note**
> This project is part of a M1 study done at the University of Strasbourg, France.

To install qtspim, please ensure you have the right minimal dependencies installed :

```bash
cd vm && sudo dpkg -i qtspim.deb
sudo apt-get install libgl1 libxkbcommon-x11-0
```

Then compile a release version of the program with :

```bash
make release
```

The produced executable binary is to be found inside of the `bin` folder.

## üíÅ More infos and Usage

The program takes command line arguments from (`..` indicating no short option, `<>` that an argument is required and `*` mutual incompatibility) :

| command             | hint                                     | required ? | default |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------- |
| `-h, --help`        | display help and **exit**                | ‚ùî         |         |
| `-v, --version`     | display version and **exit**             | ‚ùî         |         |
| `-l, --license`     | display license and **exit**             | ‚ùî         |         |
| `-i, --in` `<>`     | path to input file                       | ‚úîÔ∏è         |         |
| `-o, --out` `<>`    | path to output file                      | ‚ùå         | `a.s`   |
| `.., --tos`         | display the Symbol Table on running time | ‚ùå         |         |
| `.., --verbose`     | be very noisy                            | ‚ùå         |         |
| `.., --no-exe`      | do not execute output file               | ‚ùå         |         |
| `-O, --optlvl` `<>` | set optimization level (from `0` or `1`) | ‚ùå         | `0`     |

Note that at the time of writing, the only optimization level implemented is `0`. Furthermore, `-i` and `-o` can be omitter, provided that both (if both) are typed in order. If only one option is used without the hint, you can specify it wherever you want in the command line.

A legal launching instruction could be :

```bash
./bin/sos -o out.s examples/hello_world.sos --tos --verbose
```

<!--

**What's with the optimization level ?**

- constant expression evaluation
- not bothering to evaluation everything related to unused objects
- first order instructions group

**What is working ?**

- standard console i/o
- primitive types
- variable declarations
- first order keywords

-->

## üß™ Testing

Oh god... please don't.

Still, make sure you have `valgrind` up and ready and then run :

```bash
cd tests && make check_quiet
```

## üîÑ Changelog

<details>
  <summary>  V1 First Release Version (click here to expand) </summary>

**v1.1** boy do i hate makefiles

- properly linked lex/yacc objects file this time
- `dispose_on_exit` was being changed on `-i` instead of `-o`
- removed `-Werror` compile flag until `static int input(void)` is either used or no longer static
- added `-Werror` back (with `%option noinput` in `./gen/lexer.l`)
- created grammar (shoutout to ThomasD !)

**v1.2** but what is a quad ?

- `quad`, `symtable` and `vec` header files
- `vec` should now be thread safe (still need unit tests for that)
- updated doc
- implemented `symtable` (not based on `dict` - might change that later)
- `quad` is a struct with a `type` and a `value`
- do I go along the AST route? send help

**v1.3** memory

- implemented `.data` segment
- assembly instructions stack
- now we compile
- `--no-exe` flag to not run the compiled assembly file

**v1.4** the end is near

- more to assembly instructions stack for `j` and `jal`

</details>

## üêõ Bugs & TODO

**known bugs** (final correction patch version) [see Issues](https://github.com/ThomasByr/SoS2MIPS/issues)

- ~~`qtspim -file ./vm/qtspim/helloworld.s` is failing to parse the assembly file~~
  (not a bug, please just do not use `-bare`)

**todo** (first implementation version)

- [x] add lex/yacc to makefiles
      (throw `.h` to [inc](inc/) folder and `.c` to [src](src/) folder ; then add files to wildcard) [v0.2.1]
- [x] make sure qtspim is properly working
      (dump in some [example files](vm/qtspim/helloworld.s)) [v0.1.1]
- [x] create grammar
      (that's a big fish, please send help) [v1.1]
- [ ] improve error messages on `yylex` and `yyparse`
      (point the current line and make a suggestion)
- [ ] standard console i/o
      (`echo` and `read`) [`echo` v1.3 - pending]
- [ ] primitive types
      (`int`, `float`, `char` -> dynamic types)
- [x] variable declaration
      (support scope : all variables are global by default [?](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Local-Variables.html), unless `local` is used) [v1.3]
- [ ] function declaration
      (no keywords, no arguments : `funname() { ... }`)
- [ ] first order keywords
      (`if` `then` `for` `do` `done` `in` `while` `until` `case` `esac` `echo` `read` `return` `exit` `local` `elif` `else` `fi` `declare` `test` `expr`)
- [x] comments
      (with `/**/` from `/*` until `*/`) [v1.2]
- [ ] optimization level 1.0
      (evaluate constant expression at compile time)
- [ ] optimization level 1.1
      (do not evaluate anything related to unused objects)
- [ ] optimization level 1.2
      (group first order lazy instructions : eval + test -> test)
- [ ] support multiple files
      (multi-core compiling)
